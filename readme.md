My Garage 2.0 JQuery
====================

An updated version of the My Garage 1.0 Javascript (https://github.com/devjanaprime/myGarage_ver1.0_JavaScript) project using JQuery.

Once recreated this repo, you'll be at about 1.9. Correct the look of the inputs and change the Styling as you see fit. To get to 2.0.

Potential Next Steps (in addition to the upgrades from the previous JS only project)
----------------------------------------
* make sure there are no blank input fields
* check that the "year" as input by the user is a number
* confirm that the picURL is in fact a URL (has "http://" or "https://" within it's text)
* if any of the above tests aren't passed use JQuery's fadeIn/fadeOut to flash the offending input field(s) along with an alert
* show/hide cars using JQuery animation methods
